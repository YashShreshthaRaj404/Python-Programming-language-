# This is Python version 3.14.0 
# PYTHON

Python was created by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM, on February 20,1991.

PYTHON is a computer programming languages often used to build websites and software, and analyze data.


## Using Python 

Installable Python kits, and information about using Python, are available at python.org.


## Build Instruction 

On Unix,Linux,BSD,macOS and Cygwin:

```bash
  ./configure
  make
  make test
  sudo make install
```
    

This will install Python as python3.

You can pass many options to the configure script; run ./configure --help to find out more. On macOS case-insensitive file systems and on Cygwin, the executable is called python.exe; elsewhere it's just python.

Building a complete Python installation requires the use of various additional third-party libraries, depending on your build platform and configure options. Not all standard library modules are buildable or useable on all platforms. Refer to the Install dependencies section of the Developer Guide for current detailed information on dependencies for various Linux distributions and macOS.

On macOS, there are additional configure and build options related to macOS framework and universal builds. Refer to Mac/README.rst.

On Windows, see PCbuild/readme.txt.

To build Windows installer, see Tools/msi/README.txt.

If you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from there. For example:

```bash
 mkdir debug
 cd debug
 ../configure --with-pydebug
 make
 make test
```




## What's New


We have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the What's New in Python 3.13 document. For a more detailed change log, read Misc/NEWS, but a full accounting of changes can only be gleaned from the commit history.



## Installing Multiple Version 

On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python using the same installation prefix (--prefix argument to the configure script) you must take care that your primary python executable is not overwritten by the installation of a different version. All files and directories installed using make altinstall contain the major and minor version and can thus live side-by-side. make install also creates ${prefix}/bin/python3 which refers to ${prefix}/bin/python3.X. If you intend to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which version (if any) is your "primary" version. Install that version using make install. Install all other versions using make altinstall.

For example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.13 with 3.13 being the primary version, you would execute make install in your 3.13 build directory and make altinstall in the others.others.
